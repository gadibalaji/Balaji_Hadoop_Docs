How to decommission host using cloudera manager

decommssion means its stop using this node. for that we need to check

first what are the roles assigned to this node which we planned for decommission

1. If roles are like HDFS, datanode and resource manager, task tracker and node amanger and regions server then we can go ahead with decommission.

if any other roles are along with above roles, we need to manually decommission and then remove the above host from cloudera manager.

after decommissioned,

we will do some santiy checks

we will remove the host from cluster and remove from cloudera manager
